# ebic rick roll C++ edition

This is just a simple program which will repeatedly rickroll and pop open a persistent window.

Don't even try to get rid of the window. Your mouse will be frozen while the application is executing and if you remove it from the task manager somehow, it will just reappear. 

This is just a very simple program that I did in 10 minutes. Don't mind me. I'm NOT responsible for your actions here. 

If you run this program, you can delete it by booting into safe mode.
